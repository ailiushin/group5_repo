#Summary of Questions to be Answered
In this project our group had many questions we wanted answered. We were curious to learn what type of crimes are the most commonly reported. We wanted to analyze what the trend in crimes reported year over year from 2019 to 2021 was. Did crimes increase? We were interested in learning of the crimes reported in Chicago how many of those crimes lead to arrests. We wanted to see if more crimes were domestic or not domestic. We analyzed whether more crimes happened during the day or at night. We looked at which districts the crimes were occuring in. We wanted to show where homicides tended to occur in Chicago with the google maps API.

Section IV 

Objective: In this section we analyzed what is the least dangerous and the most dangerous hour in Chicago based on the three-year period. Further, we wanted to have a visual representation of homicide and concealed carry violations near Loop & Millenium Park area. 

Our approach: we utilized a series of code lines to cleanse, aggregate and transform the data to plot a below bar chart. We were extremely surprised to find out that the most dangerous hour in Chicago is 12pm and the safest hour is 5am. Based on our analysis we found that the list number of crimes happen between 1am and 10am. This finding was extremely interesting as our team assumed prior to analyzing the data that most crimes happen at after midnight in Chicago.

Further, we utilized google maps api to plot homicide crimes and concealed carry violations. We picked these two types of crimes to visually understand how many severe vs light crimes happened in the loop/millennium park area over the last 3 year. Based on our analysis we conclude that loop area and millennium park are relatively safe with very little crime occurrence. We think this is mainly due to a lave police there. Two maps below summarize our findings.
